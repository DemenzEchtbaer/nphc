# NPHC: Non-Parametric Hawkes with Cumulants

This repo contains two very different works:

* NPHC2: framework to minimize a loss on ||\Phi||, with three Hawkes related constraints

* NPHC3: regression on the third integrated cumulant

See notebooks to understand how to use the class *Cumulants* and the optimization and estimation processes

# TODO

Add new solves: AdaGrad, AdaDelta
